# #SECA - Project 4
## ***New York City Record***

The City Record needs a site that can manage its API endpoints.

For this assignment we have been asked to create a Monolithic Spring Boot app that can create and manage users for the site on the backend and interfaces it with a React UI on the front end. 

They have put a heavy emphasis on writing strong test for both the UI and also the Users api calls. We will want to have feature tests as well as unit tests that cover the controller, repositories, and the UI.

Here is a link to the proposal: [Click Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fe4QMmOe6UaZObxzRkH1ji6IpXolEdQWyOSyB6qTxpE/edit?usp=sharing)
